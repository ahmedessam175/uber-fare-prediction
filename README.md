The Uber Fare Prediction project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the cost of a customer's trip in the app, based on several variables such as distance, time, and traffic.




Uber Fare Prediction is a project that uses Machine Learning to predict the cost of an Uber trip before booking. Data from past trip records is collected and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to develop a model that predicts the expected cost of a given trip. This project helps users to better plan their trips and get an accurate estimate of their costs.
